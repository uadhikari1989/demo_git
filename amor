Dear Aeleen,

I know you are upset with me but that doesn't mean that I am callin you as a piece of shit. I do have a feeling towards you. So Please don't ignore me.

I respect you and I take care of you. Please pay attention to the thing when I say rather than doing an arguement without listening properly.

Also try to minimize the call on phone so I can guide you some new things.

Please do not think yo as my sex toy also. I do have a true feeling towards you and Amy as well. Sorry Chula got mad but you love me more than Aeleen and Amy because you kiss in my nose but you mom Mrs Aria only kiss somewhere else.

With love,
Umesh
